Data Set Information:

The data-set comprises (4) sets of mobile sensor readings data (humidity, temperature) corresponding to a swarm of four (4) Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). Each USV set contains records of the format: {'USV-ID'; 'humidity-value'; 'temperature-value'; 'experiment-id';'sensing-time'} 
The swarm of the USVs is moving according to a GPS pre-defined trajectory, whose relative way-points are specified in the README.pdf file. The USVs are floating over the sea surface in a coastal area of Athens (Greece). More information on the project: [Web Link] 


Attribute Information:

Attributes: 
'device' = USV ID (String) 
'humidity' = sensed humidity value from the USV sensor (real value) 
'temperature' = sensed temperature value from the USV sensor (real value) 
'experiment' = 1 (constant real value) 
'time' = the sensing and reporting time (real value)
